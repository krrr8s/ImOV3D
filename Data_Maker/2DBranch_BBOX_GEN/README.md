# 2D Branch Bbox Preparation

Please download the original Detic project from [Detic](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detic) and place it in the following path:  
`/ImOV3D/Data_Maker/2DBranch_BBOX_GEN/Detic`.  

We have prepared a demo in the `./Detic` folder to help you understand what this step does.

## Finetune Detic for Pseudo Image (Optional)

If you find that the original bounding boxes generated by Detic are not ideal, this might be due to the high noise in pseudo images.  
Please use the code in the `/ImOV3D/Data_Maker/2DBranch_BBOX_GEN/Finetune_Detic_for_pseudo_image` folder to generate data, and follow the training method described in [Detic](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detic) to conduct the training.
