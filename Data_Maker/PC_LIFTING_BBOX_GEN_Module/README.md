# Point Cloud Lifting

### Depth Estimation

This step mainly generates metric depth maps from images. Please place the files in the root directory of [ZoeDepth](https://github.com/isl-org/ZoeDepth) and install the environment according to ZoeDepth's installation process.

### Image to PC

In this step, the RGB image, depth image, and 2D Box will be lifted to 3D to form pointcloud and 3D bbox. You can run the demo in the `IMG2PC` folder to understand what this step is doing.
